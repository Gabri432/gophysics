/*
	A package that provides different functions and constants for making some of the most common calculation in Physics.

Classical Physics, Gravity, Fluids, Termodynamics, Electromagnetism, Relativity are for now the covered areas.

As so this package does not claim to be the most extensive or the best one, but it is thought as a useful tool for the most common cases.

Formulas were taken from this italian book: Title - "Fisica Volume 1", Authors - ["P. Mazzoldi", "M. Nigro", "C. Voci"].

If you find any issue or any idea to improve the program you can use this link https://github.com/Gabri432/gophysics/issues/new.

Also If you enjoyed using this program consider putting a star in the github repository at  https://github.com/Gabri432/gophysics.
