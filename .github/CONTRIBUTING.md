# Contributing to gophysics

If you would like to contribute to this project here is a list of steps I would like you to follow.

## Want to add a new feature or make a fix?
### Your branch name
- When you create a new branch, its name should be `gophysics-<author>`.
- In case of a patch, its name should be `gophysics-patch-<author>`.

### How commits should be?
- Preferrebly frequents. Or at least avoid making huge modifications without some commits in the middle.
- Each commit in general should refer to a modification in a single file, unless that modification is really small (changing variable name, adding a comment, ...).

### Where your functions should be located?
- Currently each file in the project represents a field in Physics, like Gravity, Relativity and so on.
- But I understand that some concepts involves more areas of Physics. If it is so with the functions you have created then I would like you to add them in the `gophysics.go` file.

### How functions should be made?
- Functions should have a short description of what they do.
- Functions shouldn't be much complex.

### How to create a pull request?
- When create a pull request write a small description of what changes, or features, you have made.

### Extra
- If you speak another language, like spanish, french, german or other, consider making a `readme.es.md` or `readme.fr.md` file.

Thank you!! :)
